TrivialC does a few overly specific and unrelated tasks. Those tasks include:

1) Solving ![equation](\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\prod_{k=1}^{R}\frac{3k^3+5}{k^2}}{\sum_{j=1}^{S}\frac{\sqrt{3j^3+j+2}}{2j}}) with the inputs taken by the user.

2) Printing a diamond shape with a given height.

3) Spelling a given text backward.

4) Finding the second smallest element of a given list.

5) Filling an array with random integers but without any repetition.
